## My [Portfolio Website](https://jaidensiu.verecel.app)

This repository contains the code for my [portfolio website](https://jaidensiu.vercel.app).

Current tasks:
- Refactor to TypeScript?

What I have worked on:
- Developed a website with React.js, leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Built a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for website deployment onto GitHub Pages
- Leveraged Vercel for website deployment, and monitoring web analytics and vitals

What have I learned:
- How to use version control for my personal work
- How to use package managers
- How to optimize SEO for websites
- How to design UI for good UX following best practices and principles
- How to document my work and learning
- How to build and deploy a website!

Notes:
- To start development server ```npm start```
- To deploy onto GitHub Pages ```npm run deploy```
- For builds on Windows and macOS, command for the build script uses ```copy``` and ```cp``` respectively
