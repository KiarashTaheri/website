## Jaiden's [Portfolio Website](https://jaidensiu.github.io/)

This repository contains the code for my [portfolio website](https://jaidensiu.github.io/).

Current tasks:
- Implement a proper experience container component to have correct tags in portofolio.js and in resume format

What I learned and what I can further learn:
- Incorporate Google Search Console for SEO of my website
- How to create a website using React and host GitHub Pages
- How to document software, experiences, work, courses, and projects
- How to design well thought-out UI/UX modules that are aesthetic
- How to version control really well and use package managers
- Could use React Router to allow for multiple page routing (maybe even have a blog section for course reviews)

Notes:
- ```npm run deploy``` is what commits changes to the gh-pages branch to be rendered by GitHub Pages
    - Make sure to run ```npm run deploy``` to update GitHub Pages to deploy static React modules
- ```serve -s build``` is what builds our page which you can interact on the local host
- ```npm start``` is what starts our application on the local host and allows us to see local changes
