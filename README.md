## Jaiden's [Portfolio Website](https://jaidensiu.github.io/)

This repository contains the code for my [portfolio website](https://jaidensiu.github.io/).

What I learned and what I can further learn:
- TODO

Notes:
- ```npm run deploy``` is what commits changes to the gh-pages branch to be rendered by GitHub Pages
    - Make sure to run ```npm run deploy``` to update GitHub Pages to deploy static React modules
- ```serve -s build``` is what builds our page which you can interact on the local host
- ```npm start``` is what starts our application on the local host and allows us to see local changes
