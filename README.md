## Jaiden's [Portfolio Webpage](https://jaidensiu.github.io/) Information.

This repository contains the code for my [portfolio webpage](https://jaidensiu.github.io/)!

Notes:
- Make sure to run: ```npm run deploy``` to update GitHub Pages to deploy static React modules

- ```npm run deploy``` is what commits changes to the gh-pages branch to be rendered by GitHub Pages

- ```serve -s build``` is what builds our page which you can interact on the local host

- ```npm start``` is what starts our application on the local host and allows us to see local changes
