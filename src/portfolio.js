I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) by visualizing the dataset via scatter plots to summarize the data and relation between different features. To apply models to the dataset, I employed a linear and mutiple linear regression model to best fit a line for the number of bikes dependent on temperature. I also used a vanilla neural network to fit a curve against the data. To evaluate the models, I used metrics such a mean squared error (MSE) to quantify prediction accuracy. The findings of this project allows for ensuring a stable supply of rental bikes.',
